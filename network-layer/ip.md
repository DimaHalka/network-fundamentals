# Internet Protocol

RFC 791 describes the fundamental aspects of the Internet Protocol (IP), which serves as the network layer for the Internet, enabling the interconnection of different networks and the use of hierarchical IP addressing. The later version, IP version 6 (IPv6), is defined in RFC 2460. 

The two primary responsibilities of IP are:

**Addressing**: IP assigns a unique numerical label, called an IP address, to every device connected to a network (like your computer, phone, or smart TV). This address acts like a mailing address, specifying exactly where the data should go.


**Routing**: IP takes large chunks of data and breaks them into smaller pieces called packets. It then sends these packets from the source device to the destination device. The packets travel across the internet by being passed from one router to another, with each router making a decision about the best path to send the packet along its journey.
